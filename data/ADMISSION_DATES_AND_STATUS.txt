IST ADMISSIONS – DATES AND CYCLE (answer directly from this information)
================================================================================

IST offers undergraduate (BS) admissions ONCE A YEAR only. There is no second or spring intake for BS. The cycle is for Fall intake.

UNDERGRADUATE (BS) ADMISSION CYCLE:
- Application opening: February each year (for Fall intake).
- Application closing / last date to apply: End of June (typically June 30).
- First merit list display: August (tentative).
- Classes commencement: September (tentative).

So when someone asks "when do admissions start": Admissions open in February each year. When they ask "last date": The last date to apply is usually end of June (June 30). When they ask "when is merit list": Merit list is usually displayed in August. When they ask "when do classes start": Classes start in September.

When they ask "are admissions open": IST opens BS admissions once a year, in February, and closes by end June. So admissions are open during February to June for that year's Fall intake. Outside that window, admissions are closed until next February.

APPLICATION PROCESS (undergraduate):
- Apply online: Create an account at ugadmission.ist.edu.pk (or ist.edu.pk/admission) and complete the online admission form with required documents.
