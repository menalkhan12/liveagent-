NCFA will not only provide a place for research to all the faculty and PhD/MS scholars, but will also be a resource for providing solutions of materials related services to local industries. This initiative is expected to fill a large void, as services being offered at NCFA are currently not available in the country under a single umbrella. It would support a variety of industries by conducting Material Analysis (MA), Failure Analysis (FA), Structural Integrity Assessment (SIA) and providing Material  Process Advisory Services (MPAS). The facility, while still in its infancy, has already commenced to provide consultancy in the following areas:Failure Analysis of metal parts/components/systems by applying Root Cause Approach with the aim to ensure avoidance of similar recurrences.Provision of advisory, services or both to the desirous manufactures for:Identifying/selecting metals  processes (including alternative solutions) essentially required for developing parts/components either afresh or through reverse engineering.Inspection of raw materials, on site processing of materials (including heat  surface treatments) and the finished items.Estimation of the status of parts/components/systems with view to:Recommend necessary measures for their restoration (if required  possible).Determine the remaining safe life period, for their operational usage.Establish inspection criterion  intervals for parts/components/systems during their safe life period.Training of Human Resource:Through formal programs at IST.On-site training on need basis.In order to provide above stated services/advisory, NCFA has opted to follow modern trends being practiced worldwide in relevant fields/domains. This approach entails:Only essentially required state-of- the- art facilities be established in house.A strong pragmatic collaborative network comprising those organizations which already have some authenticated facilities be formed for gaining benefits of their expertise in specific areas and lowering the operational costs.A vibrant advisory board of domain experts (regardless of their geographical locations) be formed for sharing  exchanging experiencesOrganizations must remain connected  engaged with international community of practitioners  regulators of the domain, for remaining abreast with technological  conceptual developments NCFA plans to enhance the scope of its advisory/services gradually in a phased manner.
