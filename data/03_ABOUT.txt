At every front, we need materials with special properties. We require strong materials that can withstand high temperatures to travel in space. We require functional materials to harvest energy. We require materials with biocompatibility and bioactivity to support weakened parts of our body. Modern transport systems cannot function without rare earth metals. The air transport industry is looking for self-healing materials. The present and the future belong to those who understand materials and we are those people known as Materials Engineers.The Department of Materials Science  Engineering (MSE) at the Institute of Space Technology is a state-of-the-art department and materials dedicated labs with highly skilled and experienced faculty, engineers, and staff. Our BS program is focused on Nanotechnology, Functional Materials, Energy Materials, Composites, Polymers, Aerospace Materials, Minerals Utilization, and Failure Analysis of Materials. We equip our students with the tools of computation materials and Artificial Intelligence. We have lab facilities including SEM, XRD, FTIR, BET, AFM, Gamry Instruments, and Tribometer. Our students work with 3D printing as well as bulk and nano-coatings. We teach our graduates according to global requirements and recent research trends. Our engineering program is accredited by the Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) and is fully linked with the Outcome-based Education (OBE) System as per the Washington Accord.Our senior students have a track record of support to junior students and we arrange regular gettogethers, welcome/farewell parties. The students are encouraged to take Final Year Projects (FYPs) proposed by industry or work in specialized areas using the available state-of-the-art research facilities. The American Chemical Society (ACS) chapter of our Department received an outstanding achievement award in 2025.We have very strong MS and PhD programs as well. Our alumni are working in national and multinational companies, some are pursuing higher studies and many students have their businesses as well. We have strong interaction and scholarship opportunities for study in countries like China, South Korea, Germany, the UK, UAE, and Saudi Arabia. We believe that the MSE Department at IST is the best place to train the new generation in the Materials Engineering field. The capacity enhancement of our Department is linked with CPEC and mineral extraction and we expect that it will further boost the job opportunities of Materials Engineers who are well-versed in the advanced Materials Engineering field.Dr. Abdul WadoodHeadMaterials Science and Engineering New Announcements

The American Chemical Society (ACS) chapter of our Department received an outstanding achievement award in 2025.We have very strong MS and PhD programs as well. Our alumni are working in national and multinational companies, some are pursuing higher studies and many students have their businesses as well. We have strong interaction and scholarship opportunities for study in countries like China, South Korea, Germany, the UK, UAE, and Saudi Arabia. We believe that the MSE Department at IST is the best place to train the new generation in the Materials Engineering field. The capacity enhancement of our Department is linked with CPEC and mineral extraction and we expect that it will further boost the job opportunities of Materials Engineers who are well-versed in the advanced Materials Engineering field.Dr. Abdul WadoodHeadMaterials Science and Engineering New Announcements

Academic programs and their curricula are designed per the guidelines of the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan to align with modern technologies to bridge the applied and engineering disciplines so that an interdisciplinary research culture may prevail. Data Science and Artificial Intelligence are emerging fields that are integral parts of our undergraduate program. This would help train the students to excel in the fields of new and innovative technologies. This distinguished feature of the department is indeed a modification in the conventional graduate degree programs offered anywhere else. This would help in strengthening the mathematical as well as interdisciplinary foundations of the students. This would train students to make them highly marketable in view of modern challenges and requirements. New Announcements

AboutThe Department of Applied Mathematics  Statistics was established at the Institute of Space Technology (IST) in September 2014. Academic programs and their curricula are designed per the guidelines of the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan to align with modern technologies to bridge the applied and engineering disciplines so that an interdisciplinary research culture may prevail. Data Science and Artificial Intelligence are emerging fields that are integral parts of our undergraduate program. This would help train the students to excel in the fields of new and innovative technologies. This distinguished feature of the department is indeed a modification in the conventional graduate degree programs offered anywhere else. This would help in strengthening the mathematical as well as interdisciplinary foundations of the students. This would train students to make them highly marketable in view of modern challenges and requirements.
