Pakistan’s Lunar CubeSat onboard Chinese Chang’E 6 Mission
Introduction

=== ICUBE-Q LUNAR MISSION ===
In 2022, the China National Space Agency (CNSA), through the Asia Pacific Space Cooperation Organization (APSCO), offered member states a unique opportunity: to send a student-built payload to the Moon onboard the Chang'e 6 mission. Pakistan's Institute of Space Technology (IST) answered the call with a proposal for a Lunar CubeSat named "ICUBE-Qamar" (ICUBE-Q for short). After a rigorous evaluation process, IST's proposal was selected. The design and development of ICUBE-Q are a collaborative effort between IST faculty and students, Pakistan's national space agency SUPARCO, and China's Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). IST has a proven track record in CubeSat development, having successfully launched its first CubeSat, ICUBE-1, in 2013.

Mission Overview & Objectives

The project overall consists of three main parts: the CubeSat itself, the separation mechanism (including the power control box), and the mounting bracket. ICUBE-Q weighs approximately 7 kg and carries two optical cameras to image the lunar surface. It also features essential systems for attitude control, thermal management, and deep-space communication. The main mission objectives are as follows:

Primary Mission Success

Successful separation of the ICUBE-Q CubeSat into lunar orbit from Chang’e-6 Orbiter
Use of the Orbiter camera to record the release process of ICUBE-Q
Secondary Mission Success

Successful reception of beacon signal from ICUBE-Q, confirming successful operation of the CubeSat
Tertiary Mission Success

=== QUALITY ENHANCEMENT CELL DETAILS ===
Quality Enhancement Cell - Institute of Space Technology, Islamabad
During recent years, the realization of need for quality assurance in higher education has become a global phenomenon. Pakistan also felt the need to assess and improve the quality of higher education with the objectives of achieving international competitiveness and compatibility of our academic programs and research quality.

Quality Assurance is the means through which an institution can guarantee with confidence and certainty, that the standards of its educational provision are being maintained and enhanced.

Quality enhancement is taking deliberate steps to bring about continual improvement in the effectiveness of the learning experience of students. In QE there is greater emphasis on Internal QA and the encouragement of an institutional “Quality Culture.”

Developing an internal quality assurance mechanism in every institution is highly important. This acts as a sustainable base for External Quality Monitoring. Self Assessment, being one of the tools used for achieving Quality Assurance is conducted by the institution itself. It is meant to assess whether the existing programs are able to meet the educational objectives and outcomes with the purpose and aims of improving the outcomes and outputs of the education system.

Institute of Space Technology (IST) has always been in the forefront for accepting and adapting best practices in the field of Education. Recognizing the role that it has to play in higher education sector, IST has established a Quality Enhancement Cell. This cell has the responsibility to ensure that the university’s quality assurance procedures are compatible with international standards and are designed to improve the quality of higher education

 IST Feedback System
IST has established a proper feedback system for assessing requirements of its stakeholders including student, faculty, and industry, statutory and regulatory bodies. The Quality Enhancement Cell is responsible to ensure that these requirements are gathered and acquired in a reliable manner and properly addressed at the departmental as well as the Vice Chancellor Quality Assurance Committee.

IST Feedback system is based on the following important characteristics:

IST monitors, reviews and benchmarks teaching and learning processes continuously and brings improvement in learning instructions, teaching, curricula and institutional infrastructure.
IST monitors the effectiveness of programs to evaluate the extent to which the intended learning outcomes are being attained by students, and to ensure that appropriate action is taken to remedy any identified shortcomings.
IST students are provided full opportunity to raise, individually or collectively, matters of proper concern to them without fear of disadvantage and in the knowledge that privacy and confidentiality will be respected.
The mechanisms exist to enable open and constructive feedback to be provided by research students and their supervisors on the learning experience and support infrastructure.
The mechanisms are in place to ensure that any conclusions reached by Strategic Quality Management committee are taken into account in considering matters relating to learning, teaching, and assessment.
The use of student feedback questionnaires covers all lecture courses, and, wherever appropriate, other course elements.
The arrangements made for the analysis of the results of student feedback questionnaires; how and to who are they reported. Subject areas also ensure that there are mechanisms in place to ensure appropriate action in response to any significant issues which arise.
IST ensures that where a complaint or appeal is upheld appropriate remedial action is implemented
IST has in place effective arrangements for the regular monitoring, evaluation and review of complaints and appeals.
IST ensures that information about all complaints and appeals policies and procedures is available in accessible formats and communicated to students.

Engr. Masood Khalid Director Incharge KICSIT
Its my pleasure to welcome you at Dr. A. Q Khan Institute of Computer Sciences and Information Technology (KICSIT), Kahuta, a campus of Institute of Space Technology (IST), Islamabad. It has the privilege that it was inaugurated in November 2000 by Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan himself, the founder and then Chairman of KRL.

KICSIT aims to offer quality education at an affordable cost. Currently, it is offering two four-year degree programs as Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering (BSCE) and Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS). BSCE is accredited by PEC (Pakistan Engineering Council) and BSCS is accredited by NCEAC (National Computing Education Accreditation Council).

KICSIT is ideally located in an exclusively peaceful and secure environment. The Institute does have an elite faculty with foreign-qualified PhDs and MS degree-holders having decades of practical industrial experience, KICSIT is housed in its own purposefully-built air-conditioned campus.

In view of its increasing students strength and scope, the New Campus of KICSIT has been developed next to the lush green and scenic hills of Kahuta. This is on main Rawalpindi-Kahuta Road and covers an area of above 100 Kanals.

Though KICSIT is a small-size institute, yet by grace of Almighty it has a shining record in terms of students and alumni. A large number of alumni have joined Strategic Organizations, Armed Forces and Multinational Companies. In higher education, many studied and got degrees from US, UK and other Foreign Universities. Also, KICSIT students have been competing well in the inter-university competitions and have won many awards in sofrware, hardware and extra carrucullar areas, showing a nice grooming level prevalent here.

Thus, overall it is expected that our students find their stay at KICSIT a memorable and fruitful time period of their lives.
