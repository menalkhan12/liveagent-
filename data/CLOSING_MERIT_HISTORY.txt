IST CLOSING MERIT (LAST MERIT) – HISTORICAL DATA BY PROGRAM
All figures are closing aggregate (last candidate admitted) for BS programs. Use only for trend discussion; do not promise exact cutoffs. When caller asks "will merit increase or decrease this year", describe the pattern from this data and say it may vary.

BS Biotechnology: Offered for the first time this year. No previous closing merit data. When asked, say: "Biotechnology is offered for the first time this year, so there is no previous closing merit to share."

TREND: Over the last 6 years, closing merit has generally been stable or slightly rising for most programs. When the caller asks "will merit go up or down this year", say: Based on past years the trend has been relatively stable with a slight upward tendency; exact closing merit for the current year will be known when the merit list is published. Do not tell them to check the website or call the office; answer from this data and trend.
