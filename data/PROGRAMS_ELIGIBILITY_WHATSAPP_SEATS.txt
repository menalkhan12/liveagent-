IST PROGRAMS – ELIGIBILITY, WHATSAPP, FOCUS AREAS, SEATS
(Use for queries: eligibility for a program, WhatsApp number, seats, focus areas, diploma. Do not duplicate info already in MERIT_CRITERIA, FEE_STRUCTURE, or ADMISSION_INFO.)

DIPLOMA / DAE: IST accepts applicants with DAE (Diploma of Associate Engineering) from recognized institutions. The "Acceptable Field of Studies for DAE Applicants" lists which DAE specializations can apply to each program. When asked "does IST offer diploma?", say: IST accepts applicants with DAE diplomas. Acceptable DAE specializations vary by program—e.g. for Aerospace: Diploma in Aerospace, Auto Diesel, Automation, Mechanical, Mechatronics. For Electrical: Diploma in Electronics, Telecommunication, Electrical, Mechatronics, Avionics, Computer/IT, etc. IST offers BS, MS, and PhD degree programs. WhatsApp 03362154097 for program details.
