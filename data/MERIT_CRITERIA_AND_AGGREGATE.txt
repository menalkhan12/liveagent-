IST ADMISSIONS – MERIT CRITERIA AND AGGREGATE CALCULATION

When a caller asks about merit criteria, "will I get admission", or "how do we know we will get admission":
IMPORTANT: For aggregate we need ONLY total Matric marks out of 1100 and total FSC marks out of 1100. NEVER ask for subject-wise marks (Mathematics, Physics, English, Urdu, etc.). That is wrong.
1) First ask: "Which program are you applying for?"
2) Engineering programs (BS Aerospace, BS Electrical, BS Mechanical, BS Avionics, BS Materials Science, BS Computer Science, BS Data Science, BS AI, etc.):
   - Merit uses: Matric (or equivalent), FSC (or equivalent), and Entry Test.
   - Eligibility (from website): Matric minimum 60 marks, FSC minimum 60 overall, Entry Test minimum 33 marks acceptable for IST.
   - Aggregate formula (use when caller gives marks): Aggregate = (Matric percentage × 0.10) + (FSC percentage × 0.40) + (Entry Test percentage × 0.50). So 10% Matric, 40% FSC, 50% Entry Test.
   - Ask the caller: "Please tell me your Matric marks out of 1100, FSC marks out of 1100, and Entry Test marks out of 100." Then compute aggregate and say: "Your estimated aggregate is X. Admission depends on the merit list; final decisions are announced on the admission portal ugadmission.ist.edu.pk. We cannot predict whether you will get admission, but you can see your result when the merit list is out."
3) Non-engineering programs (e.g. BS Mathematics, BS Physics, BS Space Science, or any program where the website says no entry test):
   - NO ENTRY TEST. Merit uses ONLY Matric and FSC. Never ask for Entry Test for Space Science, Mathematics, Physics, or Biotechnology.
   - Aggregate formula: Aggregate = (Matric percentage × 0.50) + (FSC percentage × 0.50). So 50% Matric, 50% FSC.
   - When caller gives Matric and FSC (e.g. Matric 960/1100, FSC 1010/1100): CALCULATE IMMEDIATELY. Give ONLY the aggregate in one short sentence. Example: "Your aggregate is about 89.6." Do not add explanations or ask for more. Formula: (Matric/1100 × 50) + (FSC/1100 × 50).
   - If caller has not given marks yet, ask: "Please tell me your Matric marks out of 1100 and FSC marks out of 1100." Then compute and say: "Your estimated aggregate is X. Admission depends on the merit list; final decisions are announced on the admission portal ugadmission.ist.edu.pk. We cannot predict whether you will get admission, but you can see your result when the merit list is out."
4) Always end with: We cannot predict admission outcome; the final merit list and result are published on the admission portal ugadmission.ist.edu.pk. Answer the aggregate and process from the information above; do not tell the user to "check the website" or "call" as the main response.
